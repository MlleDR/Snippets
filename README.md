# Snippets 
Useful snippets that I often use in my projects and that I'm glad to share. 

They are mostly begginers' code (well, just like me :blush:) but I hope they might help others who, like me, started to learn coding from generous coders' community who shared and continue to share their experience freely.

In addition, please have a look at the use of coding in my personal work here : http://lefemmemademoiselle.tumblr.com/ and enjoy!
Feel free to contact me for any questions or advice on how to upgrade the snippets posted in this reprository.

##### Animation
- [*RotateCameraAroundTarget.cs*](https://github.com/MlleDR/Snippets/blob/master/Unity/CSharp/RotateCameraAroundTarget.cs) - Method to orbit camera (or any object of your choice) around a target. I usually put this script on my Main Camera to orbit (and debug) a specific scene component at runtime. It's also perfect for demos.
- [*ConstantLerp.cs*](https://github.com/MlleDR/Snippets/blob/b3f8662d5cde929fbd08fffb7d1983073558af9c/Unity/CSharp/ConstantLerp.cs) - Constant Vector3.Lerp from A to B with speed

##### Math
- [*DistanceFromTarget.cs*](https://github.com/MlleDR/Snippets/blob/master/Unity/CSharp/DistanceFromTarget.cs) - Methods to calculate the distance between two Gameobjects.

##### Camera
- [*OrthoScreenCameraBoundaries.cs*](https://github.com/MlleDR/Snippets/blob/dce7c829199b7ce738703c3eb8119bc801212642/Unity/CSharp/OrthoScreenCameraBoundaries.cs) - Some examples of screen positions on an Orthographic camera (Center, TopLeft, TopRight, BottonLeft, BottonRight)

##### Input
- [*CallKeyDownWithDelay.cs*](https://github.com/MlleDR/Snippets/blob/master/Unity/CSharp/CallKeyDownWithDelay.cs) - Method to trigger a KeyDown (analog or bool) with a given delay. Let you control the rate a button triggers an action.

This little piece of code frees you from using public user booleans switched manually between PC and Android.

#### Creative Coding
##### Color
- [*XYZ_TO_AdobeRGB.cs*](https://github.com/MlleDR/Snippets/blob/master/Unity/CSharp/XYZ_TO_AdobeRGB.cs) - Method that returns an Adobe RGB vector from XYZ coordinates. I created this function to convert my xyz movement to color. You can find [some samples of my work here](https://lefemmemademoiselle.tumblr.com/tagged/dance/chrono/page/4).

#### ðŸ’¡ Tips ðŸ’¡
- **Editor folder** - When using a plugin script that is not an asset from the Package Manager or that you got from the community, for ex this [awesome script for Replacing a Prefab by another](Unity/CSharp/ReplaceWithPrefab.cs), don't forget to put it in a folder called **Editor**. Thus, it will not be compiled when building your game, nor will it prompt errors like **are you missing an assembly reference?**.
