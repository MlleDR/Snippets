# Snippets 
Useful snippets that I often use in my projects and that I'm glad to share. 

They are mostly begginers' code (well, just like me :blush:) but I hope they might help others who, like me, started to learn coding from generous coders' community who share their experience freely.

In addition, please have a look at the use of coding in my personal work here : http://lefemmemademoiselle.tumblr.com/ and enjoy!
Feel free to contact me for any questions or advice on how to upgrade the snippets posted in this reprository.
