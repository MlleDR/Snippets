### Unity/C# folder
#### Basic
- [*DistanceFromTarget.cs*](https://github.com/MlleDR/Snippets/blob/master/Unity/CSharp/DistanceFromTarget.cs) - Methods to calculate the distance between two Gameobjects.
- [*MapValueToRange.cs*](https://github.com/MlleDR/Snippets/blob/master/Unity/CSharp/MapValueToRange.cs) - Method to map a value between a given range.
- [*CallFunctionAtInterval.cs*](https://github.com/MlleDR/Snippets/blob/master/Unity/CSharp/CallFunctionAtInterval.cs) - Method to call a function at a given interval.
- [*PrintOnlyOnceInUpdateMethod.cs*](https://github.com/MlleDR/Snippets/blob/master/Unity/CSharp/PrintOnlyOnceInUpdateMethod.cs) - Method that will call a function only Once in the Update() method.
- [*RotateCameraAroundTarget.cs*](https://github.com/MlleDR/Snippets/blob/master/Unity/CSharp/RotateCameraAroundTarget.cs) - Method to orbit camera (or any object of your choice) around a target. I usually put this script on my Main Camera to orbit (and debug) a specific scene component at runtime. It's also perfect for demos.

#### Android Device
- [*DetectDevice_PC_Android.cs*](https://github.com/MlleDR/Snippets/blob/master/Unity/CSharp/DetectDevice_PC_Android.cs) - Detect easily if your app is running on an Android device or in Play mode in Unity engine. This little piece of code frees you from using public user booleans switched manually between PC and Android.

#### Creative Coding
##### Color
- [*XYZ_TO_AdobeRGB.cs*](https://github.com/MlleDR/Snippets/blob/master/Unity/CSharp/XYZ_TO_AdobeRGB.cs) - Method that returns an Adobe RGB vector from XYZ coordinates. I created this function to convert my xyz movement to color. You can find [some samples of my work here](https://lefemmemademoiselle.tumblr.com/tagged/dance/chrono/page/4).
